Create a website using Codeigniter, Bootstrap and Mysql to buy and sell organic vegetable products in Pinterest style. At the bottom of each product image there are Likes and Comments icons as well as a shopping basket icon for users to buy the desired products. The product with the highest number of sales and Likes and Comments will be at the top. Thank You.
